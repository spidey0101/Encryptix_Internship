This repository contains the projects I completed during the Encryptix Data Science Internship Program.

## Projects

### 1. Predictive Modeling for Titanic Survival Analysis

**Project Explanation**: This project involved predicting the survival probabilities of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning algorithms.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementing classification algorithms
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy and ROC-AUC

**Achievements**: Successfully created a model that accurately predicts passenger survival rates.

### 2. Advanced Recommendation System Development

**Project Explanation**: Developed a recommendation system to predict movie ratings based on user preferences and genre features. Two models were created to determine the most suitable approach.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Building and tuning regression models
- Implementing and comparing different recommendation algorithms
- Evaluating model performance to determine the best fit

**Achievements**: Created accurate and efficient models for movie recommendation.

### 3. Multiclass Classification of Iris Species

**Project Explanation**: Implemented advanced classification techniques to identify iris species from sepal and petal measurements.

**Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Understanding and applying various classification algorithms
